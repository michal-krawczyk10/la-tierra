# La Tierra v. 0.1

It is my personal photo gallery website, I am publishing here my own pictures I tooked all over the World.

## Code

It is my first website I am making using Vue3 so it might look messy, although it gave me some priceless Vue skills. And I am about to improve them. :)

## Plans

I have few more ideas what to add.
I want to make each photo having it's direct link.
Also i wish to add planet map, with each pic pinned and fully clickable.
Sliding of pics on touch on mobile devices is also cool idea.

So work is still in progress.

## Enjoy!

I Hope you will apreciate both my photos and my coding skills. :)
